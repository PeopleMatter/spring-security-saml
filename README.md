spring-security-saml
====================

SAML extension for the Spring Security project
This version is created to integrate an app that uses 
spring framework 3.1.0.RELEASE and spring security 2.0.7 
with SAML, it was much simpler to backport this to use
2.0.7 of spring security than it was to bring the much
larger product up to spring security 3.x.
